# ðŸŒ€ Deploying a Simple Node.js App on AWS EKS

### A Beginner-Friendly and Cost-Effective Guide

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple Node.js application on **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** â€” without overspending.  
The goal is to help beginners and developers learn **EKS deployment** while keeping costs under **$2** using minimal AWS resources.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Most tutorials on Kubernetes jump straight into complex setups and assume deep prior knowledge.  
But in the real world, **cost matters** â€” especially for learners, small teams, and startups.

This guide shows how to:
- Deploy a simple Node.js app with a `/health` endpoint
- Configure **EKS** efficiently without overspending
- Test, scale, and clean up resources after use

By the end, youâ€™ll not only know how to deploy to AWS EKS but also learn how to **think like a cost-conscious cloud engineer**.
